This project is a predictive analysis to forecast victories in League of Legends, a game deeply meaningful to me. It uses machine learning techniques like decision trees and Gradient Boosting, along with Grid Search for hyperparameter optimization. Its personal and technical value makes it one of my favorite projects.
